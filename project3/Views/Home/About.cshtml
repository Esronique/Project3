    <p class="lead">Connect World is more than a website that helps people to upload and download documents.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Connect World started of as small technology company, strictly for students by students. The main purpose for creating the website
        was to help student all over the world. Making life easier for the students by providing them with a free and save storage where they can
        save school work.

        Connect World soon realized that they can do so much more for students. The company got bigger and so did the studnet privileges.
        Students could now access each others files if the permission was given. They can also talk in real time making use of the website to help each
        other with school work.
